"# eactive_project"

This is Python with Django Project. To create this project there are process and functionalities which I used on this project:- First of all I installed the Python along with django in my machine (system). After that I set up all the dependencies and requirements which are used in this project. In this project I used the MySQL database. Firstly I install the database and setup all the require things and setup the path. I used the database schema (MySQL WB) and performed the operation of SQL Database. Performed the some sample data. I used and install all the dependencies and setup requirements and I implemented all that things in my project. In Version Control System, I used GitHub. Firstly I created the account on github. After that loged in. Performed the operation on that. Created the New Repository with the name of assignment and used the main branch. Performed the pull request and commit changes by using the git init, git add . etc such type of commands. These are the commands which I implemented to making this project. Specified the SQL queries for this project. I have used the SQL queries:-

For inserting the data (sample data) into the "users" table:- queries-> INSERT INTO users() values(); Retrieve all users from the "users" table:- queries-> SELECT * FROM users; Retrieve a specific user by their ID:- queries-> SELECT * FROM users WHERE id= id values; These are a brief explanation of creating this project. Thank you!
